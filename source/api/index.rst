API Documentation
=================

This is the API documentation for the `seispy` package. `seispy` is divided
into two submodules: `core` and `pandas`. The *core* submodule acts as a
catch-all for most functionality right now, and the *pandas* submodule
contains I/O functionality for reading and writing database tables into
pandas DataFrame objects.
